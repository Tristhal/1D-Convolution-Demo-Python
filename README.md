# 1D-Convolution-Demo-Python

This program displays an animation, using matplotlib, of two functions being convolved together. Custom user-defined functions are supported. The matplotlib animation can be made to stop at different time points and those images can be saved seperately. The animation can also be saved as a gif excluding the programmed stop. A discrete, linear convolution is performed using numpy.

Matplotlib and numpy are required to run this program. The animated plot uses the qt5 interface and was tested in the Spyder IDE.
